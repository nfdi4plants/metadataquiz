# Metadata Quiz Tool

The **Metadata Quiz Tool** provides a user-friendly interface to help researchers identify and recommend relevant metadata standards, SWATE templates, and publication archives. The tool is designed to simplify the often complex task of metadata annotation, offering personalized suggestions through a guided quiz.

## Purpose

The goal of the Metadata Quiz Tool is to streamline the metadata annotation process throughout the research lifecycle. By answering a few simple questions, researchers can access curated lists of repositories and standards tailored to their specific research needs, ensuring that data is well-documented and meets community standards.

## How It Works

By answering just **three questions** (as shown in the screenshot below), the tool provides suggestions on:
- Metadata standards
- Minimum Information (MI) standards
- SWATE () templates
- Relevant publication repositories

Once the quiz is completed, the tool compiles and displays a list with direct links to recommended resources. Users can navigate through this list, finding both direct links to resources and additional information to guide them in metadata selection.
